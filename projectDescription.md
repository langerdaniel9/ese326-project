Project Goal

To implement and experiment the Fiduccia-Mattheyses partitioning algorithm for gate-level designs. The goal of your partitioning project is to minimize the cutset size, while meeting given area constraints fixed for the partitions. Consider two area definitions in your implementations: 1) number of gates and 2) area of the gates. Discuss the impact of the area definition on the results. 

Experiments should discuss the partitioning results and performance for different area constraints of the two partitions.

Benchmark Examples

To experiment with the developed algorithms, you will use a set of benchmark examples that can be downloaded from the link:
